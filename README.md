# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis Project  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project focuses on **data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization** to analyze supply chain efficiency and order fulfillment. Using real-world order data, I extracted key insights into **delivery performance, product logistics, and supplier behavior.**  

## 📊 Dataset Features  
The dataset consists of multiple tables covering **orders, customers, payments, products, and sellers**:  

- **Orders Table**: Tracks order status, timestamps, and delivery estimates.  
- **Order Items Table**: Contains order details, product pricing, and shipping charges.  
- **Customers Table**: Includes customer locations and identifiers.  
- **Payments Table**: Records transaction details, payment methods, and installment plans.  
- **Products Table**: Stores product categories, dimensions, and weight.  

## 🛠 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- **Orders Dataset**:  
  - Identified missing values in **delivery timestamps**.  
  - Differentiated between **delivered vs. undelivered** orders.  
  - Estimated missing delivery times for completed orders using **average delivery duration**.  

- **Products Dataset**:  
  - Addressed missing values in **product categories** by assigning a new category: `"Uncategorized"`.  

## 📈 Feature Engineering & Insights  
- **Delivery Performance Analysis**:  
  - Separated **delivered orders** to compute:  
    - 🏆 **Average Delivery Time**: **12.4 days** (298.4 hours).  
    - 📍 **State-wise Delivery Latency**.  
  - Calculated **average order approval time**: **10.3 hours**.  
  - Examined the impact of **product volume & weight on delivery time**.  

## 📊 Visualizations  
Leveraged **data visualization** to uncover:  
✅ Order processing efficiency  
✅ Delivery trends across different locations  
✅ Supplier and logistics performance  

## 🔥 Key Takeaways  
- **Data-driven insights** help optimize supply chain performance.  
- Understanding **order fulfillment trends** enables better decision-making.  
- Feature engineering is crucial for **predictive analytics in supply chain management**.
